# TVI_assessment
This is a repository to temporarily house submission for the Tissue Vision internship assessment.

The code in this repository was written in Python3, and a pre-requisite for running this code is to have the [latest version of Python3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer system. The following libraries were used:
1. `PIL`
2. `numpy`
3. `matplotlib`

All three can be downloaded using [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) with the command `pip install [insert library name]`. Note that the library `os` is required for an optional section of the code but it usually comes in-built with the Python3 installation.

There are three relevant files in this repository:
1) `TQ1_code.py` which contains the code for the answer for TQ1. This generates three files: `image_1.csv`, `image_2.csv`, and `image_3.csv` as output.
2) `TQ2_code.py` contains the code for the second part of TQ2. This should display an image as well as command-line output.
3) `written_answers.md` contains the written section for TQ2 and the response for TQ3.
